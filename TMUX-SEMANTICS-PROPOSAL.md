# Freshell Agent API: tmux-Compatible Semantics

## 1. Goal

Provide a `freshell` CLI that agents can drive from Bash with tmux-like ergonomics,
while preserving Freshell's multi-device model.

This document is a **unified cutover** design. There is no phased rollout and no
backward-compatibility path.

---

## 2. Locked Product Decisions

The following decisions are fixed:

- **Client-owned layout state**: each device is the source of truth for its own tab/pane/layout state.
- **Server as relay/cache for layout**: server forwards commands/events between devices and stores last-known snapshots; it is not global authority for live per-device layout.
- **Remote control = owner-device RPC**: layout mutations targeting another device are sent to that owner device and applied there.
- **Offline behavior**: if owner device is offline, default to explicit `DEVICE_OFFLINE`.
- **No deferred queueing / surrogate execution**: no server-side queued replay; no server-side substitute owner behavior.
- **Accepted consequence**: deterministic remote layout mutation exists only while owner device is online.
- **Unified cutover**: no legacy parser/shim compatibility mode.

---

## 3. Authority Boundaries (Critical)

The previous draft mixed ownership domains. This cutover defines them explicitly.

### 3.1 Domain A: Layout Authority (Device-Owned)

Owned by one device (`ownerDeviceId`) and mutated only by that owner device runtime:

- tab list/order
- pane tree structure (split/close/swap/resize)
- active tab and active pane pointers
- pane metadata that is UI-owned (titles, browser URL, editor path)
- mapping from pane IDs to content types and process/session references

### 3.2 Domain B: Terminal Process Authority (Server-Owned)

Authoritative on server, independent of browser presence:

- PTY spawn/kill/resize/input
- terminal output stream
- terminal ring buffer / capture source
- terminal exit status and lifecycle events

### 3.3 Domain C: SDK/CodingCLI Session Authority (Server-Owned)

Authoritative on server:

- `sdk.create/send/interrupt/kill/attach`
- `codingcli.create/input/kill`
- provider session state and event stream

### 3.4 Hard Invariant

- Layout mutations are owner-device RPC.
- Process/session operations are server-direct.
- Hybrid operations do both, in that order, with rollback rules.

This preserves your client-owned layout requirement without breaking PTY/session
correctness.

---

## 4. Device Identity and Presence

### 4.1 Device Types

- `browser`: interactive UI device.
- `cli`: headless control device used by `freshell` CLI.

Both are first-class devices for layout ownership.

### 4.2 CLI Local Device Model

`freshell` must have stable local identity.

- Device ID stored at `~/.freshell/cli-device.json`.
- On first run, generate `deviceId` and `deviceLabel` (hostname + username + suffix).
- Omitted `--device` means this CLI device.
- Tabs created by CLI default to `ownerDeviceId = <cli deviceId>`.

This resolves the "local device" ambiguity.

### 4.3 Presence Contract

- Presence comes from active WS connection + heartbeat.
- Server marks device offline after `presenceTtlMs` expiration.
- RPC routing to offline owner returns `DEVICE_OFFLINE` immediately.
- No offline replay queue.

---

## 5. Targeting Model

Ambiguous shorthand is removed.

### 5.1 Device Selector

- `--device <device-id>`: target specific owner device.
- Missing `--device`: current CLI device.

### 5.2 Entity Selectors

Allowed selectors:

- `tab:<tab-id>`
- `tab-name:<name>`
- `tab-index:<n>`
- `pane:<pane-id>`
- `pane-index:<n>` (requires explicit tab selector)
- `terminal:<terminal-id>`
- `session:<provider>:<session-id>`

### 5.3 Resolution Rules

1. Parse selector type.
2. Resolve against owner live state for layout selectors.
3. Resolve against server live registries for `terminal:` / `session:` selectors.
4. Multiple matches are hard errors (`AMBIGUOUS_TARGET`).

No tmux `session:window.pane` compatibility parser.

---

## 6. Command Routing Classes

### 6.1 Class L: Layout Mutations (Owner RPC)

Require online owner device:

- `new-tab`, `kill-tab`, `rename-tab`, `select-tab`
- `split-pane`, `kill-pane`, `resize-pane`, `swap-pane`, `select-pane`
- `open-browser`, `navigate`, `open-editor`

If target owner offline: `DEVICE_OFFLINE`.

### 6.2 Class P: Terminal Process Ops (Server-Direct)

Never routed through owner device:

- `send-keys --target terminal:...`
- `capture-pane --target terminal:...`
- `wait-for --target terminal:...`
- `list-terminals`, `respawn-terminal`, `kill-terminal`, `attach-terminal`

These remain deterministic when no browser is connected.

### 6.3 Class S: SDK/CodingCLI Ops (Server-Direct)

- `sdk.create/send/interrupt/kill/attach`
- `codingcli.create/input/kill`
- CLI aliases (`session-send`, `session-wait`, etc.)

### 6.4 Class H: Hybrid Ops (Layout + Process)

Example: `split-pane --shell`.

Execution order:

1. Owner RPC applies layout mutation and reserves new pane ID.
2. Server spawns/attaches process/session.
3. Owner RPC finalizes pane content reference (`terminalId` or `sessionRef`).

Failure handling:

- Step 1 fails: no side effects.
- Step 2 fails: owner receives compensating mutation to remove orphan pane.
- Step 3 fails: operation returns `INCONSISTENT_STATE`; server retains process and emits remediation guidance.

---

## 7. tmux Mapping (Constrained)

This proposal is tmux-like, not byte-for-byte tmux emulation.

| tmux intent | freshell command | route |
|---|---|---|
| create window/session | `new-tab` | L |
| list windows | `list-tabs` | live owner or cache if `--allow-stale` |
| split pane | `split-pane --direction ...` | L/H |
| send keys | `send-keys` | P |
| capture output | `capture-pane` | P |
| wait for completion | `wait-for` | P/S |
| kill pane/window | `kill-pane` / `kill-tab` | L |

Explicitly not supported:

- tmux target grammar (`session:window.pane`)
- transparent tmux wrapper shim

---

## 8. Critical Command Semantics

### 8.1 `send-keys`

Target forms:

- preferred: `--target terminal:<id>` (server-direct)
- allowed: `--target pane:<id>` (requires owner-online resolution of pane->terminal mapping)

Behavior:

- left-to-right token processing
- key token translation (`Enter`, `C-c`, arrows, etc.)
- `-l` means literal mode

If pane target owner offline: `DEVICE_OFFLINE`.

### 8.2 `capture-pane`

Target forms mirror `send-keys`.

Semantics:

- `-S <line>` follows tmux-style line indexing against retained history
- `-S -` means full retained history
- `-J` joins wrapped soft-lines only when wrap metadata is available
- `-e` includes ANSI; default strips ANSI

If requested semantics cannot be satisfied exactly (e.g. missing wrap metadata),
return `UNSUPPORTED_CAPTURE_MODE` instead of silently changing meaning.

### 8.3 `wait-for`

Targets terminal or SDK session references.

Predicates:

- `--pattern <regex>`
- `--stable <seconds>`
- `--exit`
- `--prompt` (terminal mode only; heuristic)

Combination rule:

- multiple predicates are **AND** conditions
- no predicates provided is `INVALID_ARGUMENT`

Evaluation model:

- server-side streaming subscription (no client polling loop)
- each predicate latches true when satisfied
- command succeeds when all requested predicates are true
- timeout returns `TIMEOUT` with predicate progress

Prompt heuristic contract:

- explicitly best-effort
- never sole correctness guarantee for destructive operations

### 8.4 `attach-terminal`

`attach-terminal --target terminal:<id> --to pane:<id>`:

- owner RPC updates pane mapping to referenced terminal
- no process transfer; only pane binding change
- requires owner online

### 8.5 `navigate`

`navigate --target pane:<id> <url>`:

- layout/UI metadata mutation owned by pane owner device
- routed via owner RPC
- validates URL before apply

### 8.6 `respawn`

Two explicit forms:

- `respawn-terminal --target terminal:<id>` (P)
- `respawn-pane --target pane:<id>` (H: owner resolves pane, server respawns bound process, owner updates refs)

---

## 9. RPC Protocol (Layout Plane)

### 9.1 Messages

- `layout.rpc.request`
- `layout.rpc.ack`
- `layout.rpc.result`
- `device.presence`
- `layout.snapshot.updated`

### 9.2 Request Envelope

```json
{
  "type": "layout.rpc.request",
  "requestId": "req_123",
  "callerDeviceId": "cli_dev_1",
  "targetDeviceId": "dandesktop",
  "command": "split-pane",
  "args": {
    "target": "pane:p_abc",
    "direction": "horizontal"
  },
  "expectedRevision": 42,
  "idempotencyKey": "idem_123"
}
```

### 9.3 Timeout/Error Stages

- `RPC_TIMEOUT`: relay-level failure before owner ack (delivery stage).
- `OWNER_TIMEOUT`: owner acked but did not complete before deadline (execution stage).

Error payload includes `stage: relay|owner`.

### 9.4 Delivery Contract

- at-most-once relay delivery
- idempotency keys required for create/split/attach/respawn
- no queued replay after reconnect

---

## 10. Cache and Read Semantics

Server cache is last-known snapshot only.

### 10.1 Read Modes

- default: live owner required for layout reads
- `--allow-stale`: permit cached layout snapshot

### 10.2 Freshness Fields

Any cache-backed result includes:

- `source: "cache" | "live"`
- `capturedAt`
- `ownerOnline`
- `ownerLastSeenAt`

Process/session reads (`terminal:` / `session:`) are live server reads and do not
require owner presence.

---

## 11. Data Model

### 11.1 Layout Entities (Authoritative on Owner Device)

Tab minimum fields:

- `id`
- `ownerDeviceId`
- `title`
- `status`
- `createdAt`
- `updatedAt`
- `layoutRevision`

Pane minimum fields:

- `id`
- `tabId`
- `ownerDeviceId`
- `kind` (`terminal|browser|editor|claude-chat|picker`)
- `status`
- `contentRef` (`terminalId` or `sessionRef` where applicable)
- `updatedAt`
- `layoutRevision`

### 11.2 Process/Session Entities (Authoritative on Server)

Terminal fields:

- `terminalId`
- `mode`
- `status`
- `createdAt`
- `lastActivityAt`
- `bufferRef`

SDK/CodingCLI session fields:

- `provider`
- `sessionId`
- `status`
- `updatedAt`

### 11.3 Revision Rules

- Revision scope: per owner workspace (single monotonic counter per `ownerDeviceId`).
- Every layout mutation increments revision by 1.
- RPC mutation must provide `expectedRevision`.
- Mismatch returns `REVISION_CONFLICT` with `currentRevision`.
- Initial revision after migration: `1`.

---

## 12. Security Model

### 12.1 Token Flow

- `AUTH_TOKEN` remains bootstrap auth for server access.
- CLI exchanges bootstrap auth for short-lived device session token via `POST /api/device-sessions`.
- Device token TTL: 15 minutes; renewable via refresh endpoint.
- Device token scopes include device-bound layout write scope.

### 12.2 Credential Storage

- CLI credential path: `~/.freshell/cli-auth.json`.
- File mode must be `0600`; refuse startup if broader.
- Child process env must never include long-lived auth tokens.

### 12.3 Authorization Rules

For cross-device layout mutation:

- same authenticated principal required
- caller must have remote-control scope for target device
- deny by default without explicit permission

### 12.4 Audit Log

Server writes JSONL at `~/.freshell/audit/remote-control.jsonl`:

- `requestId`
- `callerDeviceId`
- `targetDeviceId`
- `command`
- `result`
- `errorCode`
- `stage`
- `timestamp`

---

## 13. Migration and Cutover

Unified cutover still requires deterministic migration.

### 13.1 Client-Side Layout Migration

On first cutover startup, each device:

1. loads local tabs/panes
2. stamps missing `ownerDeviceId` with local `deviceId`
3. initializes `layoutRevision = 1`
4. writes migrated local state
5. publishes `layout.snapshot.updated` to server

### 13.2 Server Migration

- Existing cached snapshots without owner metadata are rejected after cutover.
- Server accepts only `layoutOwnershipV1` clients.
- Legacy clients are denied with explicit version error.

### 13.3 Capability Gate

`hello.capabilities` must include:

- `layoutOwnershipV1: true`
- `layoutRpcV1: true`
- `devicePresenceV1: true`

No compatibility path for old capability sets.

---

## 14. Error Model

Canonical errors:

- `DEVICE_OFFLINE`
- `RPC_TIMEOUT`
- `OWNER_TIMEOUT`
- `REVISION_CONFLICT`
- `NOT_FOUND`
- `AMBIGUOUS_TARGET`
- `INVALID_TARGET`
- `INVALID_ARGUMENT`
- `UNAUTHORIZED`
- `UNSUPPORTED_CAPTURE_MODE`
- `TIMEOUT`
- `INCONSISTENT_STATE`
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`

CLI contract:

- non-zero exit on error
- `--json` output includes `code`, `message`, `details`, and (when relevant) `stage`

---

---

## 17. Non-Goals

- tmux command parser compatibility shim
- server-authoritative global live layout state
- offline queue/replay for remote layout mutation
- CRDT/OT collaborative layout merge in this cutover

---

## 18. Rationale

This design keeps your core constraint intact (device-owned layout authority) while
resolving operational contradictions:

- Browser/device ownership governs layout semantics.
- Server-owned PTY and SDK authorities preserve reliability for agent automation.
- Remote layout mutation remains explicit and fail-fast (`DEVICE_OFFLINE`) when owner
  is unavailable.
- The CLI has a first-class device identity, so "local" is deterministic.
